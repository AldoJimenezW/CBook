** Chapter 1
*** Getting Started
The first example of the book is the classic hello world exercise.

#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>
main (){
    printf("hello, world!\n");
}
#+end_src

In this example the book teachs you how to code and compile a C program with cc.

#+begin_src bash
cc helloWorld.c
#+end_src

Delivering an output of a.out

A program in c consist of functions and variables.
- a function contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done.
- a variable store values ised during the computation.

The "main" function is where begins executing the program

The "#include <stdio.h>" tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library.

The "\n" in strings means a new line
Also you can use "\t" for tabs, "\b" for backspace, '\"' for double quote and "\\" for the backslash itself.
